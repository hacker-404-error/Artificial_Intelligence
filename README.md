## What is Artificial Intelligence?

`Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence, where Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", hence AI means "a man-made thinking power."`

It is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions. 


## Why Artificial Intelligence?
- create such software or devices which can solve real-world problems very easily and with accuracy such as health issues, marketing, traffic issues, etc.
- can create your personal virtual Assistant, such as `Cortana`, `Google Assistant`, `Siri`, etc.
- can build such Robots which can work in an environment where survival of humans can be at risk.


## Goals of Artificial Intelligence

- Replicate human intelligence
- Solve Knowledge-intensive tasks
- An intelligent connection of perception and action
- Building a machine which can perform tasks that requires human intelligence such as:
  - Proving a theorem
  - Playing chess
  - Plan some surgical operation
  - Driving a car in traffic
- Creating some system which can exhibit intelligent behavior, learn new things by itself, demonstrate, explain, and can advise to its user.


## Advantages

- `High Accuracy with less errors`
- `High-Speed`
- `High reliability`
- `Useful for risky areas`
- `Digital Assistant`
- `Useful as a public utility`

## Disadvantages 

- `High Cost`
- `Can't think out of the box`
- `No feelings and emotions`
- `Increase dependency on machines`
- `No Original Creativity`

## Types of Artificial Intelligence
![Types](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/TypesOfAI.PNG)


## Based on Capabilities

### `Weak AI or Narrow AI` :
- Narrow AI is a type of AI which is able to perform a dedicated task with intelligence.The most common and currently available AI is Narrow AI in the world of Artificial Intelligence.
- Narrow AI cannot perform beyond its field or limitations, as it is only trained for one specific task. Hence it is also termed as weak AI. Narrow AI can fail in unpredictable ways if it goes beyond its limits.
- Apple Siriis a good example of Narrow AI, but it operates with a limited pre-defined range of functions.

### `General AI` :
- General AI is a type of intelligence which could perform any intellectual task with efficiency like a human.
- The idea behind the general AI to make such a system which could be smarter and think like a human by its own.
- Currently, there is no such system exist which could come under general AI and can perform any task as perfect as a human
  
### `Super AI` :
- Super AI is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass human intelligence, and can perform any task better than human with cognitive properties. It is an outcome of general AI.
- Some key characteristics of strong AI include capability include the ability to think, to reason,solve the puzzle, make judgments, plan, learn, and communicate by its own

## Based on functionality

### `Reactive Machines` :
- Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.
- Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.
- These machines only focus on current scenarios and react on it as per possible best action.

### `Limited Memory` :
- Limited memory machines can store past experiences or some data for a short period of time.
- These machines can use stored data for a limited time period only.
- Self-driving cars are one of the best examples of Limited Memory systems

### `Theory of Mind` :
- Theory of Mind AI should understand the human emotions, people, beliefs, and be able to interact socially like humans.
- This type of AI machines are still not developed

### `Self-Awareness` :
- Self-awareness AI is the future of Artificial Intelligence. These machines will be super intelligent, and will have their own consciousness, sentiments, and self-awareness.
- These machines will be smarter than human mind.
